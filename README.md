This guide provides instructions on setting up a custom Python environment named `myenv`, installing necessary dependencies, and running the `g4f` program.

## 1. Create Custom Environment

```bash
python -m venv myenv
```

## 2. Navigate to Environment's Site-Packages Directory and Clone Repository

```bash
cd myenv/Lib/site-packages
mkdir g4f
git clone https://github.com/abdulsaheel/wisatharva.git .
```

## 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
# Activate the virtual environment
# Windows
myenv\Scripts\activate
# macOS/Linux
source myenv/bin/activate

# Install required dependencies
pip install requests pycryptodome 'curl_cffi>=0.6.2' aiohttp certifi browser_cookie3 PyExecJS 'duckduckgo-search>=5.0' nest_asyncio werkzeug loguru pillow platformdirs fastapi uvicorn flask brotli beautifulsoup4 aiohttp_socks pywebview plyer cryptography nodriver googlesearch-python
```

## 4. Start the g4f Program
